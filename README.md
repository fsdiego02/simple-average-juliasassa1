# Programming exercise

 This small project is meant as a  a companion programming exercise for 
 an introductory course on C programming.
 

## Directions

 Complete the source code so that the program compute the simple arithmetic 
 mean of the values stored in the input variables. 

 Upon execution, the program output shall comprise a real value with at 
 least two decimal places.

 Please, do not include anything else but the raw value in the output.

 Make sure your program compiles successfully with no errors or warnings.
 
 ## Reminders
 
 Please, edit the fields between `<...>` in the comments at the top of file 
 `main.c` to accordingly (give your project a cool name). 
 
 Fill in file `AUTHORS` with your personal information.

 ## Tips
 
 Before submitting your work, make sure your compiler does not issue any 
 error or warning messages, as well as it does produce the right output. 
 
 After submission, check the automatic test results to make sure
 everything works as expected. If not, make changes and resubmit 
 as many times as you need.
 
 Optionally, you are welcome to edit this file entirely to customize it 
 to your project.
